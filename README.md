Apple ID Key/Cert dumper for jailbroken iOS. Made to be used with shortcut-sign. Dumps keys and auth data to `/var/mobile/Documents/appleid-key-dumper`.

Not tested on rootless jailbreaks. Tested on iPad Mini 2 iOS 12.5.5. Should work iOS 11.0 to modern iOS.

Will be available on my personal repository shortly. Currently has pre-compiled debs in Release tab for rootful jailbreaks.
